Assignment 1:
Topic: Study of Amortized complexity
a) Dynamic table:
Implement dynamic table.
operations: push and pop.
increase the size when the table reaches a particular size on push.
decrease the size when the table reaches a particular size on pop.

select:
- ratio of increase and decrease(2 or 1.5 or 3 ...)
- threshould for increasing
- threshould for decreasing

Try:
i) with and without struct hacking

output:
- give the following statistics:
  Experiment with varying selections:
  for each insert and delete:
  	max count of operation
  	max time of operation
  	total count and average for some n operations
  	
  	
b) splay tree:
Implement a splay tree:
operations : add and search
output:
- give the following statistics:
  Experiment with varying selections:
  for each add and search:
  	max count of operation
  	max time of operation
  	total count and average for some n operations
  	
submission date and time: on or before : ...
